# IP4-PigDice

### Players
Best with 2, can work with more. (The downtime between your turns grows longer with each additional player.)

### Equipment
1 six-sided die, score sheet, pen or pencil.

### Goal
Be the first player to reach 100 points.

### Gameplay
On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either:


A 1 is rolled
The player chooses to hold (stop rolling)
If a 1 is rolled, that player's turn ends and no points are earned.

If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.

Scoring Examples
Example 1: Sherri rolls a 3 and decides to continue. She then chooses to roll seven more times (6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 1). Because she rolled a 1, Sherri's turn ends and she earns 0 points.

Example 2: Craig rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He then chooses to roll four more times (3, 4, 2, 6) and decides to hold. Craig earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6=21).

Game End
When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.

Variant
Use 2 six-sided dice. If a player rolls a single 1, the turn ends and no points are scored. However, if a player rolls double 1s, that counts as 25 points.
