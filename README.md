### Players
Best with 2, can work with more. (The downtime between your turns grows longer with each additional player.)

### Equipment
1 six-sided die, score sheet, pen or pencil.

### Goal
Be the first player to reach 100 points.

### Gameplay
On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either:
1. A 1 is rolled
2. The player chooses to hold (stop rolling)

If a 1 is rolled, that player's turn ends and no points are earned.

If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.

### Scoring Examples
Example 1: Player 1 rolls a 3 and decides to continue. She then chooses to roll seven more times (6, 6, 6, 4, 5, 6, 1). Because she rolled a 1, player 1's turn ends and she earns 0 points.

Example 2: Player 2 rolls a 6 and decides to continue. She then chooses to roll four more times (3, 4, 2, 6) and decides to hold. Player 2 earns 21 points for this turn (6+3+4+2+6=21).

### Game End
When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
